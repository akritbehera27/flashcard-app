Q: What replaces the notochord in adult vertebrates?
A: A cartilaginous or bony vertebral column.

Q: "All vertebrates are chordates but all chordates are not vertebrates." Justify.
A: All vertebrates possess a notochord during the embryonic stage (making them chordates), but not all chordates (e.g., protochordates) develop a vertebral column.
