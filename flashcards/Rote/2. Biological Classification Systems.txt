Q: What term is used for fungi known only by their asexual stage?
A: Deuteromycetes (imperfect fungi).

Q: List three examples of deuteromycetes.
A: Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Trichoderma.

Q: Which kingdom includes single-celled eukaryotes like diatoms, euglenoids and protozoans?
A: Protista.

Q: What structural feature of diatoms contributes to diatomaceous earth?
A: Silica-embedded cell walls (frustules) that fossilise as diatomaceous earth.

Q: Which protist has a pellicle instead of a true cell wall and shows mixotrophy?
A: Euglena (euglenoids).

Q: Name the four major protozoan groups and give one example each.
A: Amoeboid (Amoeba), Flagellated (Trypanosoma), Ciliated (Paramecium), Sporozoans (Plasmodium).

Q: What infectious agent is smaller than viruses and lacks a protein coat? Who discovered it and when?
A: Viroids; discovered by T.O. Diener in 1971.

Q: What are prions and name two prion diseases (one animal, one human).
A: Infectious, abnormally folded proteins causing neurological disease — BSE (mad cow disease) in cattle and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.

Q: State the three historical scientists associated with early virus research and one contribution each.
A: Ivanowsky (1892 — filtered tobacco mosaic agent), Beijerinck (1898 — named virus & contagium vivum fluidum), W.M. Stanley (1935 — crystallised TMV).

Q: What does “virus” etymologically mean?
A: Venom or poisonous fluid.

Q: What is the genetic material composition rule mentioned for most viruses infecting plants vs bacteriophages?
A: Plant viruses typically have single-stranded RNA; bacteriophages are often double-stranded DNA.

Q: Give the five principal characteristics compared in Table 2.1 (Whittaker table).
A: Cell type, cell wall, nuclear membrane, body organisation, mode of nutrition.

Q: For each kingdom, state whether a nuclear membrane is present (Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, Animalia).
A: Monera: absent; Protista/Fungi/Plantae/Animalia: present.

Q: Which kingdoms in Whittaker’s table include organisms that may be autotrophic and heterotrophic?
A: Monera and Protista (both have autotrophic and heterotrophic members).

Q: What is the mode of nutrition termed for animals (holozoic, saprophytic, etc.)?
A: Holozoic (by ingestion).

Q: Name two economically important uses of heterotrophic bacteria mentioned implicitly (or in common knowledge in the chapter).
A: Making curd (fermentation) and antibiotic production.

Q: Which protist group’s rapid blooms cause red tides? Give one genus example.
A: Dinoflagellates — example Gonyaulax.

Q: What are heterocysts and which group has them?
A: Specialized nitrogen-fixing cells in some cyanobacteria (e.g., Nostoc, Anabaena).

Q: What structural components make bacterial capsids and how are capsomeres arranged?
A: Capsid composed of protein subunits called capsomeres, arranged in helical or polyhedral geometries.

Q: Which kingdom contains organisms with tissue/organ/organ system level organisation?
A: Animalia (and Plantae have tissue/organ levels too).

Q: State three differences between phycomycetes and ascomycetes (mycelium, asexual spores, sexual spores).
A: Phycomycetes: aseptate coenocytic mycelium, asexual zoospores/aplanospores produced in sporangia, zygospores sexual. Ascomycetes: septate branched mycelium, asexual conidia on conidiophores, sexual ascospores formed in asci.

Q: Which fungal division commonly forms edible morels and truffles?
A: Ascomycetes.

Q: Name the protist group that is the chief “producer” in oceans.
A: Diatoms (Chrysophytes).

Q: Give two distinguishing morphological features of bacteriophages shown in the text figure.
A: Head (capsid), tail with tail fibres and collar/sheath structure.

Q: Define phycobiont and mycobiont in lichens.
A: Phycobiont = the algal (photosynthetic) partner; mycobiont = the fungal (heterotrophic) partner.

Q: What discovery/feature made Mycoplasma notable in the Monera discussion?
A: They completely lack a cell wall and are the smallest living cells known; can survive without oxygen and are often pathogenic.
