A: Feathers, hollow pneumatic bones, fused sternum/keel in many, forelimbs modified to wings, air sacs supplementing lungs.

Q: What distinguishes birds’ heart and thermoregulation from reptiles?
A: Birds have a four-chambered heart and are homoiothermous (warm-blooded), enabling high metabolic rates for sustained flight.
